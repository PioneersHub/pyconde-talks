# VS Code Configuration
#
# These specific VS Code files are tracked to provide:
#  - Consistent development environment setup across the team
#  - Recommended extensions for this project (extensions.json)
#  - Shared debugging configurations (launch.json)
#  - Build and automation tasks (tasks.json)
#  - Project-wide editor settings (settings.json)
#  - Development setup scripts (scripts/)
#
# If you need to use different personal settings:
#  1. Use VS Code's multi-layered settings. User Settings override Workspace Settings
#  2. Or prevent Git from tracking your local changes:
#     git update-index --skip-worktree .vscode/settings.json
#  3. To later accept updates from the repo:
#     git update-index --no-skip-worktree .vscode/settings.json
#
# Non-VS Code users can safely ignore these files.
